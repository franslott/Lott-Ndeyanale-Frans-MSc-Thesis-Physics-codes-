This are the codes used for my Masters of science thesis Project at the University of Namibia to determine the Water vapour Content at the Gamsberg Mountain.

This codes will not be present in the Hardcopy version of my thesis and will instead be here for and in the electronic version of the thesis. This is mainly because of the space it ocupies.
